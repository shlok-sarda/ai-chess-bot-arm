# AI Chess Playing Robot 🤖♟️

This is a DIY robot that plays chess using a SCARA robotic arm and a custom AI built with Pytorch. You input a move, and it physically plays it on the board.

## 🔥 Demo
[Watch on YouTube](https://your-youtube-video-link)

## 🛠 Features
- SCARA arm with Arduino + CNC shield
- Chess AI built with Python and pytorch
- Camera input or manual move feed
- Real-world robotic execution of moves

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `Arduino Codes/`: Arduino code for the robot arm
- `AI/`:  AI code video
- `circuit diagrams/`: Circuit diagrams 
- `stlfiles/`: stl files for sacara arm
- `demo_videos/`: Links or media

## 🚀 How to Build It Yourself

### Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- stepper motor drivers(name*) + Stepper Motors+ power supply(name)*
- pytorch, Python 3.9+
- 3D Printer (optional for custom arm parts)

### Setup

1. Upload `arm_code.ino` to Arduino
2. Train/run the AI model with `tensorflow_model.py`
3. Use command interface to enter chess moves
4. Robot picks the piece and plays it!

## 📚 Learn & Extend
- Try integrating voice commands
- Add camera vision for automatic board scanning
- Improve AI using Stockfish API or Reinforcement Learning
